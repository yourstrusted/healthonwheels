		<h2> About us </h2>
		<p> we are a non for profit organisation based out of bangalore. our motto is to deliver health care to the needy around the city.he two most common types of links are links to other pages of the same website and links to other websites. These links are identified by their href attribute values, also known as their paths.

Links pointing to other pages of the same website will have a relative path, which does not include the domain (.com, .org, .edu, etc.) in the href attribute value. Because the link is pointing to another page on the same website, the href attribute value needs to include only the filename of the page being linked to: about.html, for example.

Should the page being linked to reside within a different directory, or folder, the href attribute value needs to reflect this as well. Say the about.html page resides within the pages directory; the relative path would then be pages/about.html.

Linking to other websites outside of the current one requires an absolute path, where the href attribute value must include the full domain. A link to Google would need the href attribute value of http://google.com, starting with http and including the domain, .com in this case.

Here clicking on the text “About” will open the about.html page inside our browser. Clicking the text “Google,” on the other hand, will open http://google.com/ within our browser.
